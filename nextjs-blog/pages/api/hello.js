//? req is an instance of http.IncomingMessage, plus some pre-built middlewares.
//? res is an instance of http.ServerResponse, plus some helper functions.

//! You should not fetch an API Route from getStaticProps or getStaticPaths. Instead, write your server-side code directly in getStaticProps or getStaticPaths (or call a helper function).
//! Hereâ€™s why: getStaticProps and getStaticPaths run only on the server-side and will never run on the client-side. Moreover, these functions will not be included in the JS bundle for the browser. 
//! That means you can write code such as direct database queries without sending them to browsers. Read the Writing Server-Side code documentation to learn more.
export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({ text: 'hello' });
