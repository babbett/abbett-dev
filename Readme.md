# abbett.dev

Portfolio website built with Next.js and TypeScript. 
TailwindCSS is used for styling. Hosted on Vercel.
- `/nextjs-blog` was created by following the tutorial found in the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app/setupnextjs-blog)
- `/abbett-dev` contains the source code for [The Site](abbett.dev)

---

In Progress:
- Online multi-user chat and simple game server (using Firebase)

Future:
- Rewrite in Next.js 13
- Add some basic TailwindCSS components for quicker/more consistent development. (basically my own version of [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com))
- Add a bunch of little games (chess, go, weird experimental stuff...). Easy drop in/drop out multiplayer, no email accounts, no ads. Think cross-platform GamePigeon.
